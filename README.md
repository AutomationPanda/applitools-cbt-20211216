# Applitools Workshop: Modern Cross-Browser Testing

This repository contains the example code for the
[Modern Cross-Browser Testing](https://applitools.com/crossbrowser-testing-workshop/) workshop
led by [Pandy Knight](https://twitter.com/AutomationPanda)
and hosted by [Applitools](https://applitools.com/)
on December 16, 2021.


## Abstract

As organizations double down on digital,
the concept of quality has evolved from “does it work” to “is it the best experience”
— but the race to deliver innovation to market faster than the competition is causing challenges for software teams.

More frequent releases multiplied by an explosion of device/browser combinations and increased application complexity
has exponentially increased the number of screens that need to be validated each cycle –
an industry average of 81,480 screens to 681,296 for the top 33% –
and traditional test automation can’t keep up.

In this 1-hour interactive workshop
you will learn how industry leaders are integrating cross-browser testing into CI/CD
for faster and immediate feedback.

**Highlights:**

* The importance and evolution of cross browser testing
* Critical requirements for a scalable cross browser testing initiative and pros/cons of different approaches
* How to accelerate cross browser / cross device testing for integration into CI/CD


## Outline

TBD


## Architecture

This project is a small Java test automation project containing test cases
for an [Applitools demo site](https://demo.applitools.com).
It uses [Apache Maven](https://search.maven.org/) for dependency management.
Each test case covers the same login behavior, but they do so in different ways:

1. One runs the test using traditional assertions on the local machine.
2. One runs the test using Visual AI with [Applitools Eyes](https://applitools.com/products-eyes/)
   and [Ultrafast Grid](https://applitools.com/product-ultrafast-test-cloud/).


## Prerequisites

To complete this workshop, you will need:

1. An Applitools account

3. [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) (up-to-date version)
4. [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/) (matching version installed on system path)
5. A Java IDE like [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
